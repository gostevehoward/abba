# Abba: A/B test analysis in Javascript and Python

Abba is a library for A/B test analysis. It analyzes tests with binomial outcomes for any number of
groups. You can use the Javascript library (in `abba/`) to just compute statistics or to render a
nice table summarizing those statistics. There's a [handy little app][github-io-demo] in `demo/`
which demonstrates how to use the library. There's a Python version under `python/`, also available
on [PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ABBA/).

You can find a usable app and detailed documentation on the
[live demo][github-io-demo].
